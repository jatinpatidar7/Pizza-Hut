# Pizza-Hut
This project involved an end-to-end SQL analysis of Pizza Hut sales data to extract actionable
business insights. Using advanced SQL concepts such as JOINs, aggregate functions, CTEs, window
functions, and ranking, the analysis uncovered key order trends, revenue drivers, and customer
preferences. The findings highlighted peak ordering hours, top-performing pizza categories, most
popular sizes, and high-revenue pizza types, along with cumulative and category-wise revenue
contributions. Overall, the project demonstrates strong proficiency in SQL-based data analysis,
business problem-solving, and translating raw transactional data into meaningful insights to support
data-driven decision-making
